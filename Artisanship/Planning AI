What is our overall objective?

Create an AI that is able to achieve 150 points as fast as possible, to beat other AIs.

If a 7 is rolled, go back to stage one until done

What is our planned method?

	1. Mr Pass – starts spinoff if it has necessary resources, otherwise it passes. This is required.
	2. ..
	3. ..
	4. …
	
	
CONSIDER:

Necessity of which resources to win?

THD, BPS, BQN, MJ, MTV, MMONEY

Where will the AI source its KPI points from?

10 – Per Campus
20 – Per GO8 Campus
2 – Per Arc Grant
10 – Per IP
10 – Most publications
10 – Most Arc Grants

150 Needed to win.

Requirements

Campus – BPS , BQN, MJ, MTV
Converting a campus to a GO8 campus - 2x(MJ), 3x(MMONEY)
Owning an ARC grant - BQN, BPS
Start a business spinoff (1/3 chance of patenting) - MJ,MTV,MMONEY

BENEFITS

Campus – grants 1 resource of surrounding discipline per turn.
GO8 Campus – grants 2 resource of surrounding discipline per turn.

START WITH

Campus – 2.

BPS – 3.
BQN – 3.
MTV – 1.
MJ – 1.
MMONEY – 1.
THD – 0.

VALUE

BPS              – Low-Moderate (Campus, arc).
BQN            –  Low-Moderate (Campus, arc).
MTV            – High-Moderate (Campus, spinoff).
MJ               – Highest (Business spinoff, GO8 and campus).
MMONEY   – Moderate (spinoff, GO8).
THD             – Zero (Nothing)

NECESSITIES FOR VICTORY

	1. Business spinoffs.
	2. Campuses at the most important resources.
	3. Arc grants to connect these campuses for expansion.
	4. GO8 Campuses at most important resources.

STAGES OF GAMEPLAY 
	
mechanicalTurk.c Plan

STAGE 1 – EXPANSION AND COLLECTION:

ACTIONS:
	• Locate nearby resources deemed important
	• Calculate most profitable path of expansion
	• Build arcs outwards
	• Build campuses at chosen points
	• If blocked by another player: Either end stage or attempt second best expansion point
	• Stop at a deemed point (decide through playtesting or stop when efficiency of path drops and future expansion will solely serve costly to overall objective)
	
REQUIRED RESOURCES:
	- Campus : 4, Spinoff : 2, Arc : 2, GO8 : 2
	• MJ – Highest Constant (Campus + Spinoff + GO8) 
	• MTV – High Relevance (Campus + Spinoff)
	• BPS – Moderate Relevance (Campus + Arc)
	• BQN– Moderate Relevance (Campus + Arc)
	• MMONEY – Low-Moderate Relevance, High Future (Spinoff + GO8) 

REQUIRED RESOURCES:
	• MJ – 7
	• MTV – 6
	• BPS – 4
	• BQN– 4
	• MMONEY – 8
	• THD – 0


REQUIRED FUNCTIONS:
	• mostProfitable(dice, disciplines, Game g, position_a, position_b). //two campuses to begin with.
	• blockedExpansion(dice, disciplines, Game g, positionWhenBlocked, blockedVertex). //consider if expanding through arc or campus building.
	
STAGE 2 – UPGRADES

Short round.

ACTIONS:
	• Upgrade most important few campuses to GO8s
	• Make decision dependent on what resources have been collected so far
	• If arc extensions are available buy them as BPS and BQN are not needed for spinoff (mathematically guaranteed 6 > 3.33 average)
	
REQUIRED RESOURCES:
	- Which campus will be the most important?
	- MJ,MTV,MMONEY
	• MJ – Highest Relevance(Campus + Spinoff + GO8)
	• MTV – High Relevance (Campus + Spinoff)
	• MMONEY – Highest Relevance, High Future (Spinoff + GO8)
	• BPS – Low Relevance (Campus + Arc)
	• BQN– Low Relevance (Campus + Arc)
	
REQUIRED RESOURCES:
	• MJ – 10
	• MTV – 10
	• BPS – 4
	• BQN– 4
	• MMONEY – 10
	• THD – 0
	
REQUIRED FUNCTIONS:
	• MostNecessary(Game g) //use maths to calculate what needs upgrading (so spinoffs will have equal by end)
	

STAGE 3 – SPINOFF FOCUS - Win

Short round.

ACTIONS:
	• Purchase spinoffs
	
REQUIRED RESOURCES:
	• MJ – Highest Relevance(Campus + Spinoff + GO8)
	• MTV – High Relevance (Campus + Spinoff)
	• MMONEY – Highest Relevance, High Future (Spinoff + GO8)
	• BPS – No Relevance (Campus + Arc)
	• BQN– No Relevance (Campus + Arc)

NOTES


Goal: 150 KPI points

1/11 turns every MTV + MMONEY -> THD (when a 7 is rolled).

Have you seriously not learnt the rules

Spinoff – 33% chance of IP, else publication.

Convert a normal campus into a GO8 campus
there can be at most 8 GO8 campuses, no more can be created after the first 8

From <https://www.openlearning.com/rendering/xcomponent/rich-text-display/?version=latest&uid=94525621b3&logLevel=error&xcomponent=1> 

Do we prioritise getting one of these first????


Double GO8Values(Game g); //what is needed for GO8 builds (only necessary to identify big surpluses).
Double mostProfitable(Game g);
